# A-POWER-BI-PROJECT
This is a project that analyses the growth and challenges of a fashion brand.   I created a dashboard that will help showcase my findings in the dataset.   Generally, this project was an excellent opportunity to apply what I  learnt in the training and gain hands-on-experience with a real world data. 

## Introduction


My current training at Dahel Techies included a Power Bi Project focused on Amazon Fashion Sales Analysis. 
This project allowed me to practice my data cleaning, analysis, and vitualization skills using Excel and Power query editor. 
Additionally, I created a reporting dashboard to showcase my findings from the dataset. 
Generally, the  project gave me a great opportunity to apply what I have learnt in my training and gain experience with a real-world data. 

## Project Objectives:

- Clean and Transform the dataset using Power Query.
- Model the data to establish logical relationships where necessary.
- Create calculated columns/measures using DAX to enhance insights.
### Design a visually appealing dashboard to provide insights into:
- Sales trends and revenue performance.
- Top-rated and best-selling products.
- Inventory management.
- Discounts impact on product ratings or sales.
- Seller performance comparison.
- Prime vs non-Prime sales impact.

## Data Preparation / Cleaning

This dataset was shared among Dahel Techies Students, showing sales of Amazon Fashion Brand Analysis. 
It has one table; (25 Columns, and 1998 rows).


## Data Cleaning and Transformation. 

For the Amazon Fashion Sales, I uploaded the data to Excel Power Query Editor where I replaced the ‘NULL’  values in the ‘Left in Stock’ column with ‘0’.
I filled the emply cells with their respective column name accordingly. 
For example; The empty cells in the ‘Brand Column’ was filled with ‘No Brand’. 

## Data Modelling.

Because the dataset has only one table, I didn’t create a relationship. Hence, I obtained all my values from the same table. 


## Recommendation

- A good number of customers rated the products and gave their reviews. 
It would be important as a brand to go through those reviews accordingly to serve our customers better.

- Fashion business is a niche that will continuously generate revenue, we should consider opening more stores in cities with large sales and stock more female wears because according to our category, they were sold faster than the other categories. 

- From the total sales revenue by delivery type, the merchants delivered higher product generating about $20,609,383.67 in total sales. Hence, more goods should be delivered through the merchants.
